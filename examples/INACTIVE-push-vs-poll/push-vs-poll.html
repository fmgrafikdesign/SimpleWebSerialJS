<p>This example shows the difference between <em>pushing data</em> and <em>polling for data</em>. When you're pushing
    data, i.e. by sending an event in the loop() method on the Arduino or a setInterval in your JavaScript, you're
    sending events no matter what. Depending on the size and complexity of your program, this might end up hurting
    performance, or even prove to be too much data for the serial connection.</p>
<p>The alternative is polling for data. This means it is your job to tell your programs when to ask for new data, e.g.
    after X seconds or when the user makes an interaction to request it.</p>

    const PUSH = 0;
    const POLL = 1;

    // Our program mode for demonstration purposes. Starts in PUSH mode
    let mode = PUSH;

    // Controls an LED
    let on = 0;

    const conn = SimpleSerial.connect();

    /* PUSH: The web page sends */
    let interval = setInterval(sendLEDState, 20)

    function sendLEDState() {
        conn.sendEvent("led", on);
    }

    function toggleMode() {
        if(mode === PUSH) {
            mode = POLL
        } else {
            mode = PUSH
        }
