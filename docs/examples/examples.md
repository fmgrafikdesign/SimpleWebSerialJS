# Examples

All examples can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/fmgrafikdesign/SimpleWebSerialJS/tree/main/examples) of the repository. They consist of a html file you can open in your browser and an `.ino` file you must upload to your Arduino (make sure you have [installed the library](../installation/arduino.md)).

Many (but not all) examples require some amount of wiring on the Arduino in order to work correctly, like wiring up a button, an led or a potentiometer. The code is usually simple enough to the point where the wiring should be obvious, but fritzing schematics will be included in a future version.
